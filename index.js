I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.



The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game
