//*psedocode for rock paper scissors activity*//

If rock competes with scissors, rock will win
If scissors competes with paper, scissors will win
If rock competes with paper, paper will win
If rock compeptes with rock, players will draw
If scissors competes with scissors, players will draw
If paper competes with paper, players will draw

//* The above translated into code*//


I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
var rps= ["rock","paper","scissors"
I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.



The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game
----------------------------------------------------------------
 Correct format for psudocode:
          
// Is there going to be a computer compnent?
// What's the first step?
// Renact RPS
// How to submit my own choise for r.p.s
   
// Prompt the user to enter "r," "p," "s"
// How is the oppnenet going to retrieve their choice?
// Initialise 'Choices' array r.p.s representing rock,paper, scissors
// Computer chooses a **random** value from the array of "r," "p," "s" using math.random
// Do I need multiple rounds? Do I need to track wins, loses and ties? I do need to tracks wins, losses and ties
// Variables then set up a bunch of if/else statements that checks for win/loss/tie conditions
          . For either of the choicees, increment the result in the choice variable. For example if the user choice ==== "r" && computerchoice ==== "s" [win
 alert("You Win"):
 Do I need to prompt user play again? Yes that way there are multiple games
